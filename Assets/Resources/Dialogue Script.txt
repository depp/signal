S02L01Y: You - Umm… hello?
S02L02R: ??? - Oh thank goodness! Listen, I’ve been trapped in here for God knows how long, and I can’t get out!
S02L03R: ??? - Can you find a way to get this door open?
S02L04Y: You - Help me out here. Where are you?
S02L05R: ??? - I’m in the bell tower of the church! I think the only way out is blocked from the outside!
S02L06Y: You - OK, sit tight, I’ll try and get you out.

%entering church
S03L01Y: You - Alright, I’m in.
S03L02R: ??? - Look for a door on the right—should lead you right up to the belltower.

%first lock encounter
S04L01Y: You - OK, I’m at the door. It doesn’t seem to be blocked by anything,
S04L02Y: You - but there’s some sort of combination lock on it.
S04L03R: ??? - It has to be around here somewhere… right?
S04L04Y: You - I hope so… I’ll take a look around.

%discover letter puzzle
S05L01Y: You - I found a letter down here. Something about a lockdown of a city?
S05L02R: ??? - Yeah, that one was for me. I wanted to send her letters back, I really did,
S05L03R: ??? - but those bastards at the post office blocked mail from leaving the city.

S06L01Y: You - What was her name?
S06L02R: ??? - Abigail, but she preferred Abby. When things went bad, she went back home to see her family.
S06L03Y: You - And never came back…?
S06L04R: ??? - *sigh*…

%discover candle puzzle
S07L01Y: You - I’m in the confession booth—I think there are some clues here we can use.
S07L02Y: You - It looks like people etched their confessions right into the wood.
S07L03R: ??? - Huh. Who knew it would take the end of the world for people to clear their conscience?

%complete candle puzzle
S08L01R: ??? - I remember every day I had to light all those candles, and I hated it. 
S08L02R: ??? - Those things would never stay lit for more than ten minutes.
S08L03R: ??? - Heh. It seems ridiculous to complain about things like that now…
S08L04Y: You - When did you get a chance to light all these candles?
S08L05R: ??? - You know, I wasn’t always stuck up here.

%discover stained glass puzzle
S09L01Y: You - So how did you end up in a church of all places?
S09L02R: ??? - This place used to be a shelter when things started to go south. Resources ran out, and so did the people.
S09L03R: ??? - I’m the only one who stuck around. Went upstairs to look for supplies one day… and well, here I am.

%complete stained glass puzzle
S10L01R: ??? - You know, I remember when this place was still running, people coming in and out at all hours of the day.
S10L02R: ??? - I know that most of them weren’t here to talk to me, but any human contact was nice…
S10L03R: ??? - I miss it so much…… I’m glad you’re here.

%lock encounter
S11L01Y: You - Ok, I think I got it!
S11L02R: ??? - Thank goodness! OK, come on up. There’s something you need to see.

%end dialog 
S12L01Y: You - Wait… what are you?
S12L02R: ??? - OK… I know this isn’t what you were expecting.
S12L03Y: You - Yeah, what the hell? What’s going on?!
S12L04R: ??? - Look, I know I look different from you, but you have to understand!
S12L05Y: You - But this isn’t how this was supposed to go! I thought you were human! I thought you were alive!
S12L06R: ??? - I was alive! I am alive! I may have lost my body, but I’m still here, and talking to you reminded me of that.
S12L07R: ??? - Since this world ended, I haven’t had anybody. You know what that’s like, don’t you?
S12L08R: ??? - You’ve been alone this whole time, too.
S12L09Y: You - *sigh* Yeah, I know it’s not easy. But—
S12L10R: ??? - Answer this one question for me honestly: when you were out there and first heard my voice, why did you follow it?
S12L11Y: You - I guess… it’s just been so long since I’ve spoken with another person.
S12L12R: ??? - “Another person.”
S12L13Y: You - …Yeah.
S12L14R: ??? - So… what now?
