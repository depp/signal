%first lock encounter

: ??? - It has to be around here somewhere… right?
: You - I hope so… I’ll take a look around.

%discover candle puzzle

%complete candle puzzle
: ??? - I remember everyday I had to light all those candles, and I hated it. Those things would never stay lit for more than 10 minutes.

: ??? - You know, I wasn’t always stuck up here.

%discover stained glass puzzle
: You - So how did you end up in a church of all places?
: ??? - This place used to be a shelter when things started to go south. Resources ran out, and so did the people.

%complete stained glass puzzle

%end dialog 
: You - Wait … what are you?
: ??? - OK … I know this isn’t what you were expecting.
: You - Yeah, what the hell? What’s going on?!
: ??? - Look, I know I look different from you, but you have to understand!
: You - But this isn’t how this was supposed to go! I thought you were human! I thought you were alive!
: ??? - I was alive! I am alive! I may have lost my body, but I’m still here, and talking to you reminded me of that.
: ??? - Since this world ended, I haven’t had anybody. You know what that’s like, don’t you?
: ??? - You’ve been alone this whole time to.
: You - *sigh* Yeah, I know it’s not easy. But—
: ??? - when you were out there and first heard my voice, why did you follow it?
: You - I guess … it’s just been so long since I’ve spoken with anybody. 
: ??? - “Anybody.” Not anything. Anybody.
: You - Yeah.
: ??? - So… How do you feel about this?
